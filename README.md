## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel, a backend developer based in Poland.

Focused on building practical and scalable systems.

I enjoy turning ideas into reliable backend architectures and continuously refining my engineering skills by learning from real-world problems and hands-on experimentation.

My main stack is Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS (primarily S3).

I’ve also worked with TypeScript, NestJS, Prisma, and occasionally React / Next.js.

Fun facts:
* Train at the gym twice a week
* Fluent in Polish and Russian with full professional proficiency in English  
* Learning to play acoustic guitar in my free time
