## Hi there 👋

I'm Daniel, a backend developer based in Poland.

Focused on building practical and scalable systems.

I enjoy turning ideas into reliable backend architectures and continuously refining my engineering skills by learning from real-world problems and experienced developers.

## 💻 Technical Focus

### Primary Stack

* Java
* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* AWS (primarily S3)

### Additional Experience

* TypeScript
* NestJS
* Prisma ORM

While backend development is my primary focus, I’ve also contributed to frontend layers when necessary using tools like React and NextJS, which helped me to have a better understanding of full-stack system interactions and API design from both sides. 


## 🚀 Current Learning & Growth

I strongly believe that deliberate practice compounds over time. Right now, I’m focusing on:

* Data Structures & Algorithms ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Daniel1234567/) practice)
* Deepening my AWS knowledge beyond basic service usage
* Database migration tools like Liquibase and Flyway
* Writing cleaner, more maintainable, production-ready backend code

My goal is to become not just a backend developer, but a well-rounded software engineer with strong fundamentals and system-level thinking.

## 🧠 A Bit About Me

* Train at the gym twice a week
* Fluent in Polish and Russian with full professional proficiency in English  
* Learning to play acoustic guitar in my free time
